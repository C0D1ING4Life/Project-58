        <h3> Why I love Reading </h3>
        <p> Reading is a fascinating hobby as it opens and adventure in the reader`s mind. There are different types of books that can take you to mind-blowing situations or the love of comedy. Hello, my name is Yuwan Sudhakar and my hobby is reading. I am in Grade 6 in Good News Lutheran College and I am 11 years old. I am currently reading a book called "Restart" by Gordan Corman. The previous book I have read is called "The Terrible Two" by Jory Jhon and Mac Barnett. Even if some books are just filled with words, these words are the guide to you imagination from the book. Now that I have explained why my favourite hobby is reading, I would love if you gave it a try too! “Think before you speak. Read before you think.” - Fran Lebowitz
